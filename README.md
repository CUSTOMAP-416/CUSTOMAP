# CUSTOMAP
This project is to develop a web application that can create, edit, share and export custom graphics of maps using real-world geographic data. This app serves the needs of map enthusiasts, researchers, educators, and application developers who need map graphics that can be used for reports, social media, publications, and research papers.

Existing products on the market often focus on static maps or require a lot of technical expertise. The differentiation of our product is that we provide a user-friendly platform that allows users to create maps using data in a variety of file formats, customize map graphics, and build a shared collaboration community. With a vast array of customizable features, users can tailor their map graphics to align with specific objectives. This helps increase utilization by customizing sources of map data.

Our application focuses on creating map graphics based on administrative divisions and attaching data to those divisions. It focuses on specific features such as data attachment, collaborative editing, and multiple export formats to meet the unique needs of the target users.
