The differentiation of our product is that we provide a user-friendly platform that allows users to create maps using data in various file formats, customize map graphics, and build a shared collaboration community. With a vast array of customizable features, users can tailor their map graphics to align with specific objectives. This helps increase utilization by customizing sources of map data.

Our application focuses on creating map graphics based on administrative divisions and attaching data to those divisions. It focuses on specific features such as data attachment, collaborative editing, and multiple export formats to meet the unique needs of the target users.
